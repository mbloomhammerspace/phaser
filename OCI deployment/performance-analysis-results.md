- **Resource Utilization**: Balanced GPU usage

### Performance Tuning Results
- **Batch Size**: 256 (optimized)
- **Concurrency**: 128 (optimized)
- **Worker Count**: 16 (optimized)
- **Memory Allocation**: 8Gi limits (optimized)

## Performance Script Issues and Resolution

### Issue Identified
- **Problem**: Script used hardcoded pod name `ingestor-server-84697ff646-ksbtr`
- **Current Pods**: `ingestor-server-5df497869f-*`
- **Impact**: No data collection from outdated pod reference

### Resolution Applied
- **Fix**: Updated script to use `deployment/ingestor-server` instead of specific pod name
- **Result**: Successful data collection and analysis
- **Recommendation**: Use deployment names instead of specific pod names for scripts

### Script Improvements Needed
1. **Dynamic Pod Discovery**: Use `kubectl get pods` to find current pod names
2. **Deployment References**: Use `deployment/` prefix for stability
3. **Error Handling**: Add checks for pod existence
4. **Logging**: Improve log collection methods

## Recommendations for Future Monitoring

### Performance Monitoring
1. **Regular Script Updates**: Update pod references as deployments change
2. **Automated Monitoring**: Implement continuous performance monitoring
3. **Alerting**: Set up alerts for performance degradation
4. **Trend Analysis**: Track performance trends over time

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Batch Size Tuning**: Experiment with larger batch sizes for better throughput
2. **Concurrency Adjustment**: Fine-tune concurrency based on workload
3. **Resource Scaling**: Monitor and adjust resource limits as needed
4. **GPU Utilization**: Continue monitoring GPU distribution

### Maintenance Tasks
1. **Script Maintenance**: Regular updates to performance scripts
2. **Documentation Updates**: Keep performance documentation current
3. **Baseline Establishment**: Establish performance baselines for comparison
4. **Capacity Planning**: Monitor resource usage for capacity planning
